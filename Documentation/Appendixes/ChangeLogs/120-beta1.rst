Node Type Constraints
=====================

In a typical TYPO3 Neos project, you will create lots of custom node types. However, many node types should only be
used in a specific context and not everywhere. Using *node type constraints*, it is now possible to restrict the allowed
child node types inside a given node type. Additionally for being able to specify direct child node constraints, it is
also possible to specify grandchild constraints for auto-created node types.

See the chapter :ref:`node-constraints` for details.

Node type constraints are supported in the following places in Neos:

- "Create New" wizard in Content Module
- "Create New" wizard in Navigate component (document and structure tree)
- moving in Navigate component
- changing node type in Navigate component
