========================
2.0.0 (not released yet)
========================

*Note*: some of these release notes have been written as if the feature was already in master, although it is not fully
        the case yet. For each feature, the first paragraph highlights the current implementation status -- that
        paragraph will be removed for the final release notes.

Fine-grained Access Control
===========================

*Current Status: FIXME*

A common requirement, especially for larger websites with many editors, is the possibility to selectively control access
to certain backend tools and parts of the content. For example so that editors can only edit certain pages or content
types or that they are limited to specific workspaces. These access restrictions are used to enforce certain workflows
and to reduce complexity for editors.

With Neos 2.0, we introduce a way to define Access Control Lists (ACL) in a very fine-grained manner, enabling the
following use-cases:

- hide parts of the node tree completely (useful for multi-site websites and frontend-login) (in progress)
- protect arbitrary method calls (as possible before)
- define the visibility of arbitrary elements depending on the authenticated user (as possible before; currently being
  worked on)
- show only specific Backend Modules
- allow to create only specific TYPO3CR Node Types (being worked on currently)
- allow to only edit parts of the Node Tree (being worked on currently)
- allow to hide certain properties in the Content Inspector (being worked on currently)

The above examples are all based upon specific *privilege types*; defining *what can be access-restricted*.

Furthermore, the way Neos and Flow handle *roles* has been rewritten: A user is assigned to one or more specific
roles, defining *who the user is*. For each role, a list of *privileges* is specified, defining the exact permissions of
users assigned to each role.

In the Neos user interface, it is possible to assign not just a single role to a user, but instead a list of multiple
roles. This allows to define the permissions a user actually has on a much more fine-grained level than before, where
only the distinction between Editor and Administrator was made.


Cloud Capable Resource and Media Management
===========================================

*Current Status: The foundational change in Flow (Resource Management) has been merged. A prototype of uploading
assets to Rackspace and Dropbox is functional but probably won't make it into the final release. CSS path rewriting
is not yet implemented and would be needed for really using cloud resources.*

In today's world, the use of cloud services is very prevalent. People use Google drive, Dropbox or Box.com to share
files and assets. Furthermore, applications of today should be deployable on PAAS systems like Heroku or AWS EC2.
Because these platforms do not contain a writable and persistent file system, alternative storage systems for assets
are needed. For highly scalable websites, the use of Content Delivery Networks for serving static content helps to
keep sites performant and fast.

With Neos 2.0 and Flow 3.0, we introduce a completely written core of resource management, which has built-in
support for various cloud providers.

On the one hand, this now allows to store persistent resources like images which the user has uploaded in Amazon S3;
making Flow and Neos a lot more straightforward to run on PAAS.

On the other hand, resources which are used on the website output (like cropped and resized images) can be *published*
to a CDN like Akamai or Rackspace CloudFiles.

The cloud providers supported with Neos 2.0 will be:
- Rackspace CloudFiles / Akamai
- Dropbox
- S3??
- ???

This feature is also the basis for seamlessly choosing assets from Google Drive or Dropbox in the Neos Media Management,
which will be implemented in a later version of Neos.


Translation & Content Variants
==============================

*Current Status: all merged into master*

While translation of content, or more broadly, content variants, are the flagship feature of Neos 1.2, there were still
some missing spots to fill to make working with content variants really awesome. Neos 2.0 includes quite some of these
improvements.

First, we re-implemented the way an initial translation of a document from one language to another works. If you wanted
to translate from English to German in Neos 1.2, you needed to define that the German-language version of your page falls
back to the "English" version -- effectively showing English content if it has not been translated in German yet.
With Neos 2.0, you do not need these fall-backs anymore. Instead, if you choose a content variant which does not exist yet,
you are asked whether you want to start with an empty page or copy the original content and start modifying it.

Second, we re-thought how the node tree should behave in Neos: In order to reduce confusion, if you move a page to a
different position in the hierarchy, it is moved *in all variants*. However, if you move *content* from left to right column,
this only affects the current variant. After having tried numerous options in the last months, we believe that this
way leads to the most predictable editing experience.

Third, if you copy content from one variant to another (e.g. a content element which has been created in English, but
not yet in German), the link between the original content and the translation is now preserved. This is an important
technical foundation, based on which features such as a "list of changes in the original language" will be implemented
in later Neos releases.


Translated Neos User Interface
==============================

*Current Status: The most important change merged into Master, followups (e.g. for translating Node Type Names and JS)
still in the works.*

The User Interface of Neos is now translatable into multiple languages -- making it easier to use for non-English speakers.

Now, we need *your help*, as we still need the actual translation. Please head over to https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-neos
and https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-flow and translate the labels as you see them :)



SEO Improvements
================

*Current Status: mostly merged, except for the XML sitemap generation*

With Neos 2.0, we've added some first tools which help in improving search engine ranks:

- Separation of page and navigation title
- allow to set description, keywords and robots information per-page
- machine-readable links to alternative-language versions
- XML sitemap generation

In the longer run, we'll add some more functionality and helpers in this area.



Google Analytics
================

*Current Status: merged*

For many websites, getting key insights on their usage patterns is a requirement for improving content. That's why we started
a basic integration with Google Analytics; showing the current access numbers in an inspector tab of the current page.


History / Event Log
===================

*Current Status: Merged, but some instabilities and missing event types*

For Neos 2.0, we have explored to add an event log, which records all kinds of changes to a Neos instance. Initially,
the event log helps to answer the following questions:

- What content has changed since I have last used the system?
- Audit Logging: Which users have been created or modified?

A small History module is included which allows to browse the history.

By default, this feature is currently disabled, as the history grows quite quickly and there is no function to prune the
history yet. We also imagine that the history can be used to enable functionality like more intelligent publishing or
merging of changes.
